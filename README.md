# Price Prediction in Mumbai

This project aims to predict property prices in Mumbai using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to create a model that can accurately estimate property prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting property prices in Mumbai. The model will leverage a dataset containing various property features, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns in property valuation and provide accurate price predictions.

## Features

### 1. Data Collection
- Collect property price data from reliable sources, including details such as property location, size, amenities, and other relevant factors.
- Ensure the dataset is comprehensive and covers a wide range of property types and locations within Mumbai.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing or inconsistent values.
- Standardize data formats and encode categorical features to make them suitable for model training.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different features and property prices.

### 3. Model Training
- Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
- Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or advanced techniques like random forests and gradient boosting) to find the best-performing model.
- Tune hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness and reduce overfitting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or any other preferred Python IDE
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`


## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset by collecting and preprocessing the data.
2. Run the model training script to train the machine learning model.
3. Evaluate the model performance using the evaluation metrics provided.
